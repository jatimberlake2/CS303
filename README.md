# CS303

These are the lab assignments for CS 303 : Algorithms and Data Structures at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, all using Java

All "Lab#" folders contain the assignment for each lab, required additional files downloaded, and the associated lab report describing how each problem was solved.

"inputs" contains the latest version of each input file as they are currently displayed in the working eclipse directory I generated this code in.

The actual .java files mentioned in the associated lab reports for each lab assignment are located in the "SourceCode" folder, copied directly from my Eclipse directory.

Initially, I made seperate files for the in-class and homework portions, delineated by an added "H" at the end of some file names, but that paradigm was abandoned in later projects.

There was no lab report for the final lab.
